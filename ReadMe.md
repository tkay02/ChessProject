## Description 'What is the program supposed to do?'
Currently this program will allow you choose between a Monotone and Colored Chess Board.
Once the user has chosen a board they will be prompted to resign, if they choose not too
the user will be prompted to select a piece to move on the chess board. Once a piece is 
chosen to move, the destination is prompted. Once a valid destination is chosen the piece
is moved and then player 2 is prompted to move, then the cycle repeats until all pieces are
gone or either player resigns.

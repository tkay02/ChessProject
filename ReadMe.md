## Description 'What is the program supposed to do?'
This program allows the choice between playing chess on a command line or on a gui. If the player
selects the gui option, they will be greeted with a menu screen where they can choose between the
options of playing chess, viewing the rules, and alternating the settings. In the settings, the
player can alter the color of the squares, enable displaying moves, and/or enable the option of
undo/redo. The player can view view through the rules which displays information about piece
movement, board setup, and an overview. When the player wants to play a game, they can define who's
